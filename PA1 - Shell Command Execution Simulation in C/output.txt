       -A
           Adaptive ping. Interpacket interval adapts to round-trip time, so
           that effectively not more than one (or more, if preload is set)
           unanswered probe is present in the network. Minimal interval is
           200msec for not super-user. On networks with low rtt this mode is
           essentially equivalent to flood mode.
